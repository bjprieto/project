# EVE 198 Project

This repository was created for carrying out a student project for the UNIX-focused course in "Scientific Computing for Biologists"  (EVE 198) during spring 2023. The main focus of the project was writing the script `getbooks.sh`, which takes a file containing a list of web addresses corresponding to eBooks from Gutenberg.org, downloads said books if not already present in the working directory, and sorts them into directories by author. Additional files present were and can be used to test the `getbooks.sh`. More information on the assigned task can be found in `instructions.txt`.
